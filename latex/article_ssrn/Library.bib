  abstract = {Good macroeconomic and financial theorists, like all good theorists, want to get the facts straight before theorizing; hence, the explosive growth in the methodology and application of time-series econometrics in the last twenty-five years. Many factors fueled that growth, ranging from important developments in related fields (see Box and Jenkins, 1970) to dissatisfaction with the ``incredible identifying restrictions'' associated with traditional macroeconometric models (Sims, 1980) and the associated recognition that many tasks of interest, such as forecasting, simply do not require a structural model (see Granger and Newbold, 1979). A short list of active subfields includes vector autoregressions, index and dynamic factor models, causality, integration and persistence, cointegration, seasonality, unobserved-components models, state-space representations and the Kalman filter, regime-switching models, nonlinear dynamics, and optimal nonlinear filtering. Any such list must also include models of volatility dynamics. Models of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH), in particular, provide parsimonious approximations to volatility dynamics and have found wide use in macroeconomics and finance1. The family of ARCH models is the subject of this chapter.},

  abstract = {In recent years financial economists have increasingly questioned the efficient market hypothesis. But surely if market prices were often irrational and if market returns were as predictable as some critics have claimed, then professionally managed investment funds should easily be able to outdistance a passive index fund. This paper shows that professional investment managers, both in The U.S. and abroad, do not outperform their index benchmarks and provides evidence that by and large market prices do seem to reflect all available information.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a simple modification of a conventional method of moments estimator for a discrete response model, replacing response probabilities that require numerical integration with estimators obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. This method of simulated moments (MSM) does not require precise estimates of these probabilities for consistency and asymptotic normality, relying instead on the law of large numbers operating across observations to control simulation error, and hence can use simulations of practical size. The method is useful for models such as high-dimensional multinomial probit (MNP), where computation has restricted applications.},

  abstract = {Investors often adopt mean\textendash variance efficient portfolios for achieving superior risk-adjusted returns. However, such portfolios are sensitive to estimation errors, which affect portfolio performance. To understand the impact of estimation errors, I develop simple and intuitive formulas of the squared Sharpe ratio that investors should expect from estimated efficient portfolios. The new formulas show that the expected squared Sharpe ratio is a function of the length of the available data, the number of assets and the maximum attainable Sharpe ratio. My results enable the portfolio manager to assess the value of efficient portfolios as investment vehicles, given the investment environment.},

Gower, Department of Statistics Rothamsted Experimental Station, Harpenden, U.K. Review in Biometrics, June 1987Multivariate Observations is a comprehensive sourcebook that treats data-oriented techniques as well as classical methods. Emphasis is on principles rather than mathematical detail, and coverage ranges from the practical problems of graphically representing high-dimensional data to the theoretical problems relating to matrices of random variables.
